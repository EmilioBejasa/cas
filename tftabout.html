          Intro
        </u>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Teamfight Tactics, or TFT, is an 8-player, free-for-all strategy game
        and an autobattler using champions and their abilities in League of
        Legends(developed by the same company). It is like chess in some ways,
        which is why TFT is also called an "auto-chess" game.<br />
        The goal of the game is to get all of your opponents to 0 health by
        winning rounds with your units.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <u>How the Game is Played</u>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        There is an initial carousel stage, where 9 units spawn with item
        components, like a <span class="ad">sword</span> or
        <span class="as">bow</span
        ><span class="note"
          >(there are exceptions, such as the special carousels that can give
          everyone the same components, or even a full item.)</span
        ><br />
        In <b>Stage 1</b>, after the carousel, there are 3 rounds of minions,
        which may drop a random amount of <span class="three">gold</span>,
        items, and sometimes units.<br />
        The rest of the stages follow the same structure, and in
        <b>Stage 2-1</b> you finally face someone else. <br />
        The round structure, except stage 1, is: rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are
        rounds where your board faces another board; round 4 is another carousel
        round, with units in a carousel and an item, just like the start of the
        game; round 7 is a round you face monsters or a monster in order to get
        more items and <span class="three">gold</span>.<br />
      </p>
      <h2>
        <u class="three"><span class="three">Gold</span></u>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        <span class="three">Gold</span> in this game buys you units, refreshes
        your shop, or buys you XP to take to the next level in hopes of finding
        better units and to put more of them on your board.<br />
        <span class="three">Gold</span> can be earned after each round,
        determined by how much <span class="three">gold</span> you have, and how
        many rounds you have been winning/losing in a row(known as
        streaking).<br />
        Alternative ways to get <span class="three">gold</span> is winning a
        round(beating your opponent), an origin that will be brought up in
        Basics, and a Galaxy that will be brought up in Basics as well.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <u>Luck</u>
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        I feel like I have to address the luck in this game. There is a stigma
        about this game where's 100% luck. <br />
        Yes, this game has a lot of luck-based elements, such as what items drop
        from monsters or champions you get in your shop, but it is what you do
        with what you get(in this case getting items or champions you may not
        want) that makes you a good TFT player.
